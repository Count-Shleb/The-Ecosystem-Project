# The Ecosystem Project

My name is Caleb Patnode, and this is my senior capstone project for Mohawk Trail Regional Highschool. This project is built to simulate a virtual ecosystem populated with fictional organisms loosely based on creatures from reality.I built this project in processing, a java based ide. The senior capstone class started on 8/28/2019 and will end sometime in early to mid January. I have until then to develop this project into its final form, where in which I aim to have somewhere from seven to ten indivisual species,, all with different actions behaviors and colors.
